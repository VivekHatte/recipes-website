        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pad Thai is a popular Thai stir-fried noodle dish known for its balance of sweet, savory, tangy, and umami flavors. <br> 
            It typically consists of rice noodles stir-fried with eggs, tofu or shrimp, and a flavorful sauce made from tamarind paste, <br>  
            fish sauce (or a vegetarian alternative), palm sugar, and lime juice. Common ingredients also include bean sprouts, garlic, <br> 
            shallots, and crushed peanuts, with chili flakes added for spice. The dish is often garnished with fresh cilantro, lime wedges, <br>
            and additional peanuts for extra texture and flavor. Pad Thai is a staple of Thai street food and is enjoyed worldwide for its rich, yet balanced taste.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong> Prepare the noodles: </strong> Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions (usually soaking in hot water for 5–7 minutes until tender but still firm). Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li> <strong> Make the sauce: </strong> In a small bowl, mix tamarind paste, fish sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and red pepper flakes. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.</li>
            <li> <strong> Cook the chicken: </strong> Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the sliced chicken and cook until browned and fully cooked through (about 3–4 minutes). Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li> <strong> Stir-fry the aromatics: </strong> In the same pan, add another tbsp of oil. Sauté garlic and shallot until fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>
            <li> <strong> Cook the egg: </strong> Push the garlic and shallot to the side of the pan. Pour in the beaten egg and scramble it until just cooked.</li>
            <li> <strong> Combine ingredients: </strong> Add the cooked noodles and chicken back to the pan. Pour in the sauce and toss everything together until well coated.</li>
            <li> <strong> Add fresh elements: </strong> Stir in the bean sprouts and green onions, cooking for another minute.</li>
            <li> <strong> Serve: </strong> Transfer to plates and top with crushed peanuts, lime wedges, and fresh cilantro if desired.</li>
        </ol>
