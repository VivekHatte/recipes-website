        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A bean and cheese burrito is a simple yet satisfying Mexican-inspired dish consisting of a soft flour tortilla <br>
            filled with seasoned beans and melted cheese. The beans, typically refried or black beans, are seasoned with spices <br>
            like cumin, garlic, and chili powder for extra flavor. The cheese, often cheddar or a Mexican blend, adds a creamy, gooey <br>
            texture. The burrito is usually folded and can be served as-is or lightly grilled for a crispy exterior. Itâ€™s often paired <br>
            with salsa, guacamole, or sour cream for extra flavor.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup refried beans (or black beans, mashed)</li>
                <li>0.5 tsp cumin</li>
                <li>0.5 tsp chili powder</li>
                <li>0.25 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>0.5 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or a Mexican blend)</li>
                <li>2 large flour tortillas</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter or oil (optional, for crisping)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong> Prepare the beans: </strong> If using canned refried beans, warm them in a small pan over medium heat. Stir in cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to taste. If the beans are too thick, add a splash of water to loosen them up.</li>
                <li> <strong> Assemble the burrito: </strong> Lay a tortilla flat on a clean surface. Spread half of the warm beans onto the center of the tortilla. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded cheese on top.</li>
                <li> <strong> Fold the burrito: </strong> Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll it up tightly from the bottom to form a burrito.</li>
                <li> <strong> Crisp the burrito (optional): </strong> Heat a pan over medium heat and add a little butter or oil. Place the burrito seam-side down and cook for 1-2 minutes per side until golden and crispy.</li>
                <li> <strong> Serve: </strong> Enjoy as-is or with salsa, guacamole, or hot sauce on the side! </li>
            </ol>
