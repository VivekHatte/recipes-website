# recipes-website


This is going to be a website that I will develop over time to learn front end development. Backend is how I started and
what I have worked on throughout my career, but in the pursuit of becoming a stronger full stack dev, I am embarking on this
journey with the help of the Odin Project.

In this first iteration, my intention is to learn and demonstrate basic HTML skills. I will write a self reflection about my
progress and learnings afterwards. As I continue to work on this project, I intent to use CSS and later on Javascript to 
make the website more visually pleasing and easier to navigate.


Self Reflection (02/04/2025):

I have completed this basic front end set of webpages for my favorite recipes. The basic of HTML are easy to pick up, and I was able to complete this in a couple of hours. However
I am excited to learn a lot more. I think this is just stratching the surface of front end dev and I do not know what I do not know. I caught my self typing tags and the auto 
fill in my code editor would show tags that I did not even know about. Learning everything is something I look forward to do. 

This was a good introduction to html and I would recommend anyone to do this project just for fun and to brush up some very basic HTML skills. Here is the link: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

I look forward to add CSS styling to this website!
