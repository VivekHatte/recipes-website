# recipes-website


This is going to be a website that I will develop over time to learn front end development. Backend is how I started and
what I have worked on throughout my career, but in the pursuit of becoming a stronger full stack dev, I am embarking on this
journey with the help of the Odin Project.

In this first iteration, my intention is to learn and demonstrate basic HTML skills. I will write a self reflection about my
progress and learnings afterwards. As I continue to work on this project, I intent to use CSS and later on Javascript to 
make the website more visually pleasing and easier to navigate.
